This repository provides guidelines and scripts to convert deep learning models into TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and TensorFlow.js (TFJS). You can convert YOLOv11, Keras (e.g., ResNet50), and PyTorch models to TFLite and TFJS formats and run them efficiently.

## How to run:

Run in file  ``TFJS_TFLITE.ipynb``


## Features :
Export YOLOv11 Pose Detection 
model to TFLite and run inference

Convert Keras models (e.g., ResNet50) to TFLite

Convert PyTorch models to TFLite

Export YOLOv11 Pose Detection model to TFJS for web-based inference
